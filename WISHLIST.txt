- pyramid room boss, drops the shuttle schematics DONE
- nanite multitool DONE
- MEGACRATER (generated structure)
- minimoon (generated structure in asteroid belt-like dimensions)
- mobs
- city ruins biome
- babel fish! crafted with freq module to a translation module
- connected block textures
- auto-refilling oxygen tanks
- oxygen mask which works under water
- dyed oxygen masks (so that vos6434 calms down^^)
- GC equipment items which use energy to do special things
- GC equipment "armor stand", which equips/unequips everything onto you on rightclick, and also recharges things
- craftable, upgradeable sentry bot. floats behind the player and shoots stuff
    - better batteries increase HP? or shields?
    - switchable weapon
    - inventory/storage?
    
    *AugiteSoul's ideas, edit them whenever you want ^^*
- computercraft compat w/ MS peripherals, and auto-transit using those
- tractor beams, forcingly move a ship, uses lots of RF
- wide controllers, those can control machines you own in a large radius(disable all air locks?)
- better GC boss defeat sound, death cry looks odd w/ some bosses
- constricting attack for mummy?
- bodies for amun?
- basalt chest, more resistant, and is accessible only by the one who placed it 1st
- mission MS, automatic, can get gases from atmosphere of bodies, or ores from bodies (asteroid belts mainly)
- beamer, allows for safe descent on a body (will error when orbiting unavailable body)
- vertical thrusters and directions, for giant 1-use rockets? (aka make stars follow y-axis when all thrusters do it)
- energy golems, better stats than iron ones, uses RF, and defends robot villages
- make proper moons textures, a number of them uses a dummy texture
- make the gas collectors harvest very little random gases (space isn't fully empty!)
- dark matter collector, collect dark shards when in transit
- procedural attackable enemy ships
